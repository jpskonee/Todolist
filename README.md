Create a Dynamic Personalised List by adding the name of the list in the extention of the url after a forward slash (/)

Example: To create a Work list, you enter: https://quiet-sands-50985.herokuapp.com/Work
 Or "Project Steps" list, you write: https://quiet-sands-50985.herokuapp.com/Project Step (Don't panic about the space, an an npm dependecy, "lodash" would take care of that.
