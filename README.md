# Todolist
Heruku Link: https://arcane-atoll-60843.herokuapp.com

Dynamic Todolist created with:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, BOOTSRTAP, JAVASCRIPT
Backend: Node.js, Express
Templating: EJS
Database: MongoDB Atlas


Create a Dynamic Personalised List by adding the name of the list in the extention of the url after a forward slash (/)

Example: To create a Work list, you enter: "https://arcane-atoll-60843.herokuapp.com/Work"
 Or "Project Steps" list, you write: "https://arcane-atoll-60843.herokuapp.com/Project Step" 
 Note: Don't panic about the space in the url, as an npm dependecy, "lodash" would take care of that.
